Gini iOS Vision documentation
=============================

Introduction
------------

Gini provides an information extraction system for analyzing documents (e. g. invoices or
contracts), specifically information such as the document sender or the amount to pay in an invoice.

The Gini Vision library for iOS provides functionality to capture documents with mobile phones running the iOS operating
system. The captured images are automatically enhanced and optimized on the device so they provide both the
best results when used with the Gini API and an optimized user experience.
