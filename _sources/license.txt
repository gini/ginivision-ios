License
=======

The Gini Vision Library is licensed under a Private License and also
integrates several third party libraries. To add all license notices and
permissions required to your application you can either use the prebuild files
provided by CocoaPods or you can add them manually.

.. note:: Irrespective of the option you choose always make sure to ship all license notices and permissions with your application.

Using CocoaPods
===============

CocoaPods makes it easy for you to integrate licensing notices into your
application. After installing or updating the SDK, CocoaPods generates two
``Acknowledgements`` files for each target specified in your Podfile. There is a
markdown file, for general consumption, as well as a property list file that can
be added to a settings bundle.

All required licenses for the Gini Vision Library will automatically be
added to those files.

For further information on how to use CocoaPods to display acknowledgements
inside your app or in the Settings application refer to the `CocoaPods Wiki on
Github <https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/wiki/Acknowledgements>`_.

Manually
========

If you prefer adding the licenses manually use the Markdown content provided
here to satisfy all license requirements.
