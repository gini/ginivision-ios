Getting started
===============

The Gini Vision Library for iOS is shipped as a Cocoa touch framework. You must integrate the
framework into your application before you can use it.

First of all: Integrate the library
===================================

The library contains of three files:

- The ``GiniVision.framework`` containing the library in a binary form.
- The ``GiniVision.bundle`` containing all UI assets (images, storyboards, etc).
- The ``opencv.framework`` containing a build of the third-party OpenCV library.

It is absolutely necessary that you add all three files. Otherwise the framework and therefore
your application may crash.

To add the library to your application, simply drag the files from Finder and drop into your
application's files (on the left side of XCode). There will appear a popup where you have to select
the target. Make sure that you select the correct target (which is the target of your application).

Set the linker settings
=======================

The Gini Vision library for iOS is written in Objective-C++, not in Objective-C. Because of that,
you need to set a linker flag. Otherwise your application will not build due to linker errors. In
the Build Settings of your application, you need to add the value ``-l"stdc++"``.

.. hint:: If you see "Apple Mach-O Linker Errors", for example "Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64"
          it is very likely that you forgot to set the linker flag or set the linker flag incorrectly.


Please make you sure that you also link all the needed iOS frameworks. You can check it in the
"Linked Frameworks and Libraries" section in the General settings page of your applciation's target.

The needed iOS frameworks are:

* CoreMedia.Framework
* AVFoundation.Framework

Next: Use the Scanner Activity
==============================

After you have integrated the Gini Vision library for iOS successfully and your application you are
good to go. Learn next :ref:`how to scan a document. <guide-using-the-scanner>`.
